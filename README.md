## ewd-qoper8-gtm

This module may be used to simplifiy the integration of the GT.M database with ewd-qoper8 worker process modules

## Installing

       npm install ewd-qoper8-gtm
	   
## Using ewd-qoper8-gtm

This module should be used with the start event handler of your ewd-qoper8 worker module, eg:

    this.on('start', function(isFirst) {
      var connectGTMTo = require('ewd-qoper8-gtm');
      connectGTMTo(this);
    });

This will open an in-process connection to a local GT.M database.

ewd-qoper8-gtm will load and initialise the ewd-globals module, creating a globalStore object within your worker.

ewd-qoper8-gtm takes responsibility for handling the worker's 'stop' event, but provides you with 3 new events that you may handle:

- dbOpened: fires after the connection to GT.M is opened within a worker process
- dbClosed: fires after the connection to GT.M is closed within a worker process.  The worker exits immediately after this event
- globalStoreStarted: fires after the globalStore object has been instantiated.  This is a good place to handle globalStore events, 
 for example to maintain global indices

The dbOpened event provides you with a single status object argument, allowing you to determine the success (or not) of
opening the connection to GT.M, so you could add the following handler in your worker module, for example:

    worker.on('dbOpened', function(status) {
      console.log('GT.M was opened by worker ' + process.pid + ': status = ' + JSON.stringify(status));
    });


The dbClosed and globalStoreStarted events provide no arguments.
